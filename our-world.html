                In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum is a placeholder text 
                commonly used to demonstrate the visual 
                form of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful content.
                Lorem ipsum may be used as a placeholder before final copy is available. It is also used to temporarily replace text in a process called greeking, which allows designers to consider the form of a webpage or publication, without the meaning of the text influencing the design. Lorem ipsum is typically a 
                corrupted version of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a 
                1st-century BC text by the Roman statesman and philosopher
                 Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical and 
                 improper Latin. Versions of the Lorem ipsum text have been used in typesetting 
                 at least since the 1960s, when it was popularized by advertisements for
                  Letraset transfer sheets.
